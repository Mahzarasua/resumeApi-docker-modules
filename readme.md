## About The Project

This project was created using Java and Springboot, it will help you to see how it works with 2 different databases.

It is the same implementation of Resume API but adjusted to use Mongo as DB in one implementation and PostgresDB in the
other.

Most of the coding should be the same and you will find small differences in the way the Models and Repositories were
created.
